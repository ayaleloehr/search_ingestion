We are working collaboratively across the organization to make this migration to the platform possible. The process will begin immediately following the beta release of vets.gov in November 2015. The overall migration will be prioritized into waves in order to take a repeatable and scalable approach that will expedite the migration process and minimize risk: Wave 1: content only; no PII / no PHI Wave 2: content and services (including forms) PII (low complexity) Wave 3: content and services; PII and PHI Wave 4: content and services: PHI (high complexity) VA stakeholders will attend a bi-weekly avets.gov 101a session. This is the first step in the migration process. During the session, the vets.gov team will provide an overview of the project and migration process, review existing tools (e.g., vets.gov Style Guide), answer any questions, and provide a migration questionnaire (link to an online form). VA stakeholders fill out the online form that is submitted to the vets.gov team for review. The vets.gov team will review the questionnaire and determine if it is in the scope of vets.gov. (Note: corporate content such as press releases, executive bios, press releases, reports, etc. will continue to reside on VA.gov.) If a request appears out of scope, the vets.gov team will contact the submitting stakeholder to confirm this. The vets.gov team will contact the stakeholder to set up a working session to discuss next steps and determine which wave the site or service fits within. This a collaborative process and VA stakeholders will help determine when to schedule migration activities. Step 6a: If a site/service is determined as a wave 1 or 2, then the team will begin the defined vets.gov product development process. [link] Step 6b. If a site/service qualifies as waves 3 or 4 additional planning and technical due diligence will be required. The vets.gov team will work collaboratively with VA stakeholders to develop a planning schedule. Wave 3 and 4 projects begin the defined vets.gov product development [link] process after the completion of planning ad technical due diligence.

Are you eligible for benefits? Yes, if: You are a Veteran or the dependent of a Veteran who is eligible for transfer of entitlement for the Post-9/11 GI BillA(r), or you are the child of an active-duty Servicemember who is the recipient of a transfer of entitlement. You are eligible to receive 100% Post-9/11 GI BillA(r) benefits. Is this me? Your school participates in the Yellow Ribbon Program for the 2015-16 school year. You maintain continuous enrollment, full- or part-time, as defined by your school. You are working toward the completion of your enrolled program. Who is covered You and your family members Available benefits Additional tuition How it works After you submit your application for Post-9/11 GI BillA(r) benefits and VA finds you eligible, you will receive a Certificate of Eligibility. Bring this certificate to your participating institutionas financial aid, military liaison, or other office as determined by your school, and ask to apply to your schoolas Yellow Ribbon Program. Your school will determine: Whether it has already enrolled the maximum number of participants for the program period. Enrollment is on a first-come, first-served basis. Your school and VA agree on how many students may be covered each year. What the amount of entitlement will be. This is calculated by adding up tuition and mandatory fees, and then subtracting any specific aid youave received from other sources such as scholarships or grants as well as your Post-9/11 GI BillA(r) tuition payment. Your school applies the Yellow Ribbon Program benefit to this final amount. You will receive notice from your school about whether you have been accepted to the program and about the application of the benefit to your tuition. Confirm that your school will submit your enrollment information to VA, and coordinate with VA for the application of the benefit to your tuition or fees.

Apply for Disability Benefits Fully Developed Claim The Fully Developed Claims (FDC) program is an optional way for Veterans and survivors to get faster decisions by submitting all relevant records in their possession, and those records which are easily obtainable, such as private medical records, when they make their claim and certify that they have no further evidence to submit. VA can process these claims more quickly. Disability Benefits Questionnaires (DBQs) To speed up the processing of compensation and pension claims, you now have the option of completing an examination with your own healthcare provider instead of at a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) facility. If you choose to go to your own healthcare provider, you will need to bring the appropriate Disability Benefits Questionnaires, or DBQs. These downloadable forms that are specific to your condition or symptom enable private healthcare providers to capture important information needed by VA to accurately evaluate and promptly decide on your claims for benefits. Visit our DBQ List by Form Name or DBQ List by Symptom to access the 70 forms available. See detailed instructions: Veteran VSO Health Care Provider Where can I get more information? See our DBQ Frequently Asked Questions for more information. You can also call us at 1-800-827-1000 or ask us a question online. DBQs help support VAas Fully Developed Claims (FDC) program. DBQs are valuable for claims processing because they provide medical information that is relevant to determining a disability rating. When submitted with a Fully Developed Claim, DBQs ensure VAas rating specialists have precisely the information they need to start processing the claim. If youare an active-duty Servicemember, you can initiate a predischarge claim.

Youall need to file within one year from the date on the letter notifying you about the decision on your claim. What do I file? VA Form 21-0958 Whatas next? Your local VA office will prepare and mail to you a written explanation, known as the Statement of the Case (SOC), which explains why your claim was denied. You may submit additional evidence, or request that VA obtain certain evidence for you, after you receive your Statement of the Case. Your local VA office will review your new evidence and send you a Supplemental Statement of the Case. What if I still donat agree? If you disagree with the Statement of the Case, you can file a Substantive Appeal to the Board of Veteransa Appeals. When do I file a Substantive Appeal? Youall need to file within one year from the date on the letter notifying you about the original decision on your claim or 60 days from the date on the letter accompanying the Statement of the Case, whichever gives you more time. What do I file? VA Form 9. Check the status of your appeal by calling 1-800-827-1000 or going online to eBenefits. How the Board of Appeals works: If you selected an optional in-person or video teleconference hearing with a Veterans Law Judge at the Board of Veteransa Appeals, the hearing will be scheduled at your local VA office (or in Washington, DC, if you selected that location). You may request an optional personal hearing before an adjudicator who works at your local VA office or a Veterans Law Judge who works at the Board of Veteransa Appeals. If you request an optional hearing, it will significantly delay a Board decision because optional hearings take more time to schedule. The Veterans Law Judge will make a decision on each issue of your appeal. The decision will grant, remand, or deny each issue. Grant: If an issue is granted, your local VA office will notify you of the decision made by the Board of Veteransa Appeals. Remand: If an issue is remanded, it means that one or more issues in your appeal will be sent back to a local VA office for further evidence collection. Your appeal will return to the Board of Veteransa Appeals when the local VA office complies with the Boardas remand instructions. Deny: If an issue is denied, and you want to pursue further action, you may: File a new claim with your local VA office, File a motion asking the Board of Veteransa Appeals to reconsider your appeal (there is no time limit to file this motion), File a motion asking the Board of Veteransa Appeals to review your appeal again because there was clear and obvious error in its decision (there is no time limit to file this motion), and/or File a Notice of Appeal with the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims When?

The number of classes you attend and the accompanying hours spent in those classes determine your payments. For example, a college considers: 12 or more hours full time 9-11 hours three-quarter time 6-8 hours half time Less than six hours as reimbursable at a rate thatas no more than the tuition and fees charged for the course(s) If you are interested in graduate-level training, the training time is determined by the college. For example, if a two-hour class is considered full time in a graduate program at your school, VA will pay you the full-time rate. If your school participates in the Yellow Ribbon Program, it agrees to make additional funds available for your education without charging your GI Bill entitlement. Get more information from the Yellow Ribbon Program pamphlet or go online to the Yellow Ribbon Program page. View current payment rates. You can attend more than one college at a time under the GI Bill as long as the classes at both institutions count toward your degree. However, the GI Bill will not pay you to take the same class twice, unless you receive a failing grade in a class that is a graduation requirement.The GI Bill can pay you for the classes required to achieve more than one degree. Once you earn a degree, you could pursue another one if you have remaining entitlement on your GI Bill. VA issues payments after each monthas classes. For example, you receive the November payment in December. For the Post-9/11 GI Bill, the tuition and fees are paid directly to the school, the book stipend is paid to you at the beginning of the term, and the housing allowance is paid to you at the end of each month.

Apply for Disability Benefits Accredited Representatives When filing a disability claim, it may help to work with an accredited representative who is familiar with the process and who VA considers capable of assisting you with VA-related affairs. Most accredited representatives work for veterans service organizations (VSOs), which are private nonprofit groups that advocate on behalf of Veterans, Servicemembers, dependents, and survivors. They may also work for state or county governments. The accreditation process includes the following: An examination A background investigation Continuing education requirements to ensure representatives are providing the most up-to-date information Recognized organizations and individuals can legally represent a Veteran, Servicemember, dependent, or survivor before VA. Non-recognized organizations and individuals can provide information but cannot be representatives. What is the role of an accredited representative? Accredited representatives are trained to help you understand and apply for any VA benefits you may be entitled to, including: Compensation Education Vocational rehabilitation and employment Home loans Life insurance Pension Health care Burial benefits Additionally, accredited representatives can help you gather evidence and can submit a Fully Developed Claim on your behalf. Is there a cost? Many VSOs provide their services free of charge, though they may request reimbursement for unusual expenses. Unlike VSOs, VA-accredited claims agents and attorneys may charge for their services. If you believe you were charged an unreasonable fee by a claims agent or attorney, see How to Challenge a Fee. How do I find a representative? You can find a local representative, including a recognized VSO, an attorney, or a claims agent, by state/territory, zip code, or the organizationas name online using eBenefits. To find a VSO office located in or near your local regional benefit office, use our directory of VSOs. The VA Office of General Counsel also maintains a list of VA-recognized organizations and VA-accredited individuals authorized to assist in the preparation, presentation, and prosecution of VA benefit claims. You can get more information about selecting a representative or file a complaint about your representative. How do I designate a VSO or representative? You can notify VA that you will be using a representative or modify your current representation online using eBenefits. You may also notify VA by completing VA Form 21-22 and mailing it to your nearest VA regional benefit office. Please speak to the service organization or representative before you submit your request.

If this is the case, you can file a Secondary Disability Claim to seek additional benefit. Example 1:A Veteran has a service-connected knee injury that causes him to walk with a limp. He subsequently develops arthritis in his hip. Although the arthritic condition did not start during, nor was it aggravated by service, service connection may still be established if the arthritis is a result of his previously established service-connected knee condition. Example 2:A Veteran was in the Army for twenty years. During her military service, she was diagnosed with hypertension. After her discharge, service connection was established for hypertension. She was subsequently diagnosed with a coronary artery disease that resulted from her hypertension. Service connection for her coronary artery disease may be established via a Secondary Claim.

Who is covered You Available benefits Temporary increase in compensation benefits Health care benefits Temporary 100% disability rating How it works A temporary 100% rating is for convalescence based on surgery or immobilization of a joint by a cast without surgery for a service-connected disability. The temporary 100% rating may continue for one to three months depending on individual circumstances, with possible extensions up to an additional three months in severe cases. Example A Veteran has a left knee condition that resulted in a 30% disability rating. Due to further deterioration of the knee, the VA physician recommended surgery to arrest the problem. Since the success of the surgery wonat be known for three months following the one week of hospitalization, VA granted the Veteran a temporary 100% disability rating for three months.

Are you eligible for compensation? Yes, if: You have at least one service-connected disability rated at least at 60%, or two or more service-connected disabilities, at least one of which has a 40% or more disability rating, and a combined rating of 70% or more. You are unable to maintain substantially gainful employment as a result of service-connected disabilities. Marginal employment, such as odd jobs, is not considered substantially gainful employment for VA purposes. In exceptional cases such as frequent hospitalization, this benefit may be granted at a lower disability rating. Who is covered You Available benefits Compensation Health care How it works When filing your claim, be sure to provide evidence or statements that your disability is preventing you from maintaining substantially gainful employment. Your work and education history will be reviewed. Example A Veteran has a service-connected heart condition that has been evaluated as 60% disabling. She has been able to work without difficulty until last year, when she began to experience chest pain with any exertion. Her physician recommended that she retire as soon as possible. She filed a claim for increased disability compensation. Evidence regarding the Veteranas work history and education were reviewed, and she was designated as individually unemployable due to her service-connected disability and entitled to compensation at the same rate as a 100% disabled Veteran. </div> Please note: Content on this Web page is for informational purposes only.A It is not intended to provide legal advice or to be a comprehensive statement or analysis of applicable statutes, regulations, and case law governing this topic.

Some of these documents may be in your possession or easily available to you, but VA will need your authorization to access others. The documents youall need to provide include: Discharge or separation papers (DD214 or equivalent) Service treatment records (if they are in your possession) Medical evidence (private doctor and hospital reports) According to the Veterans Claims Assistance Act (VCAA) passed by Congress in 2000, responsibility for obtaining evidence to support a claim is as follows: VAas responsibility Obtaining relevant records from: Any federal agency, including the military VA medical centers, including private facilities where VA has authorized treatment The Social Security Administration Providing a medical examination or obtaining a medical opinion, if required to decide the claim. The Veteranas responsibility Obtaining relevant records not held by a federal agency. This may include records from: State or local governments Private doctors and hospitals Current or former employers Note: VA may assist in obtaining these records. Providing relevant information to VA so that records can be requested. Example A Veteran filed a disability claim that indicated previous treatment from a private doctor and a previous Social Security disability award. In this case, VA is responsible for obtaining the Social Security records and can assist in obtaining the private physician records. However, ultimate responsibility for obtaining the private records lies with the Veteran. Evidence Procedures for Fully Developed Claims and Standard Claims Fully Developed Claims The Fully Developed Claim program allows you to speed up the claim-resolution process. You need to submit the following when you file your formal claim: All relevant service-treatment and personnel records Any pertinent private medical records Disability benefit claims are considered fully developed when you have no more evidence to submit and the only assistance required from VA is obtaining federal records and facilitating or providing additional medical examinations or opinions. More information about this program is available on the Fully Developed Claims page. Standard Claims Evidence procedures for standard claims place greater responsibility on VA to assemble relevant records from both federal sources and private sources that you identify and authorize. These may include: Privately held evidence and information that you tell us about (such as records from a private doctor or hospital), and Records from state or local governments or current or former employers. VA will provide a medical examination for you, or will get a medical opinion, if itas required to make a claims decision.

Apply for Disability Benefits Accredited Representatives When filing a disability claim, it may help to work with an accredited representative who is familiar with the process and who VA considers capable of assisting you with VA-related affairs. Most accredited representatives work for veterans service organizations (VSOs), which are private nonprofit groups that advocate on behalf of Veterans, Servicemembers, dependents, and survivors. They may also work for state or county governments. The accreditation process includes the following: An examination A background investigation Continuing education requirements to ensure representatives are providing the most up-to-date information Recognized organizations and individuals can legally represent a Veteran, Servicemember, dependent, or survivor before VA. Non-recognized organizations and individuals can provide information but cannot be representatives. What is the role of an accredited representative? Accredited representatives are trained to help you understand and apply for any VA benefits you may be entitled to, including: Compensation Education Vocational rehabilitation and employment Home loans Life insurance Pension Health care Burial benefits Additionally, accredited representatives can help you gather evidence and can submit a Fully Developed Claim on your behalf. Is there a cost? Many VSOs provide their services free of charge, though they may request reimbursement for unusual expenses. Unlike VSOs, VA-accredited claims agents and attorneys may charge for their services. If you believe you were charged an unreasonable fee by a claims agent or attorney, see How to Challenge a Fee. How do I find a representative? You can find a local representative, including a recognized VSO, an attorney, or a claims agent, by state/territory, zip code, or the organizationas name online using eBenefits. To find a VSO office located in or near your local regional benefit office, use our directory of VSOs. The VA Office of General Counsel also maintains a list of VA-recognized organizations and VA-accredited individuals authorized to assist in the preparation, presentation, and prosecution of VA benefit claims. You can get more information about selecting a representative or file a complaint about your representative. How do I designate a VSO or representative? You can notify VA that you will be using a representative or modify your current representation online using eBenefits. You may also notify VA by completing VA Form 21-22 and mailing it to your nearest VA regional benefit office. Please speak to the service organization or representative before you submit your request.

The effective date is when benefits are payable to you. This varies with the type of benefit youare applying for and the circumstances of your claim. How Effective Dates Are Assigned Below are explanations of how effective dates are determined in various cases. Direct Service Connection The effective date for a disability that resulted from or was aggravated by military service is either: The date VA receives a claim, or The date entitlement aroseawhichever is later. aThe date entitlement arosea means the date a doctor noted in your medical records that the condition existed. (This is also called aby medical evidence.a) The date VA receives a claim, or The date entitlement arose. whichever comes later. aThe date entitlement arosea usually means when your problem first started. If VA received your claim within one year of the day you left active service, the effective date can be as early as the day following separation. Example 1Veteran Shaun separated from active service on September 30, 2013, with a hearing disability. More than a year later, he filed a claim for his hearing problem. VA received Shaunas claim on November 15, 2014. On March 10, 2015, VA determined Shaun had a 30% disability rating with an effective date of November 15, 2014athe date VA received the claim. Example 2Veteran Ric separated from active service on September 30, 2013, with a hearing disability. Less than a year later, Ric filed a claim for his hearing problem. VA received Ricas claim on July 5, 2014. Because his claim was received within one year of separation from active service, VA awarded Ric a 30% disability rating with an effective date of October 1, 2013athe day after Ricas separation from the military. Presumptive Service Connection In most circumstances, if your disability is presumed to be related to military service and VA received your claim within one year of your separation from active service then the effective date is the date entitlement arose. (Remember a entitlement arose generally means when you first experienced symptoms.) If VA received your claim more than one year after your separation from active service, the effective date is when VA received the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. Example 1Beth, a Veteran who separated from active service on September 30, 2013, had medical tests on April 15, 2014. The doctor found she had hypertension. Less than three months later, Beth filed a claim that VA received on July 1, 2014. VA presumed her hypertension was related to her service. Because VA received the claim less than one year after Beth separated from active service, the effective date will be April 15, 2014athe date entitlement (her symptoms) arose. Example 2Susan, a Veteran who separated from active service on September 30, 2013, underwent medical tests on April 15, 2014. The doctor found she had hypertension. More than a year later she filed a claim that VA received on October 2, 2014. VA presumed her hypertension was related to her service. Because VA received the claim more than one year after Susan separated from active service, the effective date will be October 2, 2014athe date the claim was received. Reopened Claims The effective date for a reopened claim is the date VA received the claim to reopen, or the date entitlement (symptoms) arose, whichever is later. Liberalizing Law Change If there is a change in law or VA regulation that allows VA to pay disability compensation, the effective date may be assigned in the following ways:-If VA reviews a claim within one year of a law or regulation changing, the effective date may be the date the law or regulation changed.-If VA reviews a claim a or a Veteran requests a review a more than one year after the law or regulation changed, the effective date may be up to one year before the date the Veteranas request was received or the date VA found entitlement was warranted. Dependency and Indemnity Compensation For claims based on a Veteranas death in service, the effective date is the first day of the month in which the Veteran died, or was presumed to have died. Thatas true only if VA receives the claim within one year of the date of the report of the Veteranas actual or presumed death Otherwise, the effective date is the date VA receives the claim. If the Veteranas death occurred after service and VA received the claim within one year of the Veteranas passing, the effective date is the first day of the month in which the Veteran died. If the death occurred after service and VA received the claim more than one year after the Veteranas death, the effective date is the date VA received the claim. Error If VA finds a clear and unmistakable error in a previous decision, the effective date of benefits the new decision will be the date from which benefits would have been paid had there not been an error in the previous decision. Difference of Opinion A decision that is based on a difference of opinion will have an effective date of the original decision, had it been favorable. Increases Increases in the disability rating are dated back to the earliest date when it can be shown that there was an increase in disability, but only if the new claim request is received within one year from that date. Otherwise, the effective date is the date the claim was received. Disability or Death Due to Hospitalization If VA receives a claim within one year after the date a Veteran suffered an injury, or his existing injury became worse, the effective date is the date the injury occurred or when it began to get worse. If VA receives a claim within one year of the date of a Veteranas death, the effective date is the first day of the month in which the Veteran died. If VA receives a claim more than one year after a Veteran suffered the injury or his injury got worse a or he died a, the effective date is the date VA receives the claim.

Apply for Disability Benefits Fully Developed Claim The Fully Developed Claims (FDC) program is an optional way for Veterans and survivors to get faster decisions by submitting all relevant records in their possession, and those records which are easily obtainable, such as private medical records, when they make their claim and certify that they have no further evidence to submit. VA can process these claims more quickly. Disability Benefits Questionnaires (DBQs) To speed up the processing of compensation and pension claims, you now have the option of completing an examination with your own healthcare provider instead of at a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) facility. If you choose to go to your own healthcare provider, you will need to bring the appropriate Disability Benefits Questionnaires, or DBQs. These downloadable forms that are specific to your condition or symptom enable private healthcare providers to capture important information needed by VA to accurately evaluate and promptly decide on your claims for benefits. Visit our DBQ List by Form Name or DBQ List by Symptom to access the 70 forms available. See detailed instructions: Veteran VSO Health Care Provider Where can I get more information? See our DBQ Frequently Asked Questions for more information. You can also call us at 1-800-827-1000 or ask us a question online. DBQs help support VAas Fully Developed Claims (FDC) program. DBQs are valuable for claims processing because they provide medical information that is relevant to determining a disability rating. When submitted with a Fully Developed Claim, DBQs ensure VAas rating specialists have precisely the information they need to start processing the claim. If youare an active-duty Servicemember, you can initiate a predischarge claim.

Eligibility Requirements You must have been recently separated from military service with an unstable, significantly disabling service-connected disability that will continue for an indefinite amount of time. Example While in active service, a Servicemember was diagnosed with Hodgkinas disease and began chemotherapy that continued during and after her medical discharge process.

Are you eligible for benefits? Yes, if: You are the son, daughter, or spouse of: A Veteran who died or is permanently and totally disabled as the result of active service. A Veteran who was permanently and totally disabled as the result of active service and who died from any cause while in this condition. A Servicemember missing in action or captured in the line of duty by a hostile force. A Servicemember forcibly detained or interned in the line of duty by a foreign entity. A Servicemember hospitalized or receiving outpatient treatment for a service-connected permanent and total disability who is likely to be discharged for that disability. If you are the child of the Veteran or Servicemember: You must be between the ages of 18 and 26, except in special circumstances. Marriage does not disqualify you from eligibility under DEA. Should you join the military, you may not use this benefit while on active duty, and you must not be discharged under dishonorable conditions. Military service can extend your eligibility by the same number of days as your time on active duty, but this extension generally does not go beyond your 31st birthday. You may not receive Dependency Indemnity Compensation from VA if you are over 18 years old and using DEA. If you are the spouse of the Veteran or Servicemember: Your benefits begin on the date VA finds you eligible or on the date of the Veteranas death, and extend for 10 years. If the Veteran was rated permanently and totally disabled, with an effective date thatas three years after discharge, you will remain eligible for 20 years from that effective date. This new policy began on October 10, 2008, and no benefits will be paid for training you started before October 10, 2008. If the Servicemember died on active duty, your benefits end 20 years from the date of death. You remain eligible to receive DIC payments from VA. Who is covered Your dependents Available benefits A monthly payment of up to $1,021. View current rates How it works If you are a spouse, you may take correspondence courses under this program. Remedial, deficiency, and refresher courses may also be approved under certain circumstances. View current DEA pay rates. For both children and spouses, if you are eligible for both DEA and the Fry Scholarship, you must choose which of these you will use. Your choice is final and cannot be changed. Exception: If you are the child of a Servicemember who died in the line of duty before August 1, 2011, you qualify to use both benefits subsequently for up to 81 months of education and training.

Typography Vets.gov uses the open source fonts Source Sans Pro and Roboto Slab to convey clarity, warmth and credibility. Body Copy Source Sans Pro (Regular, weight 400) Source Sans Pro (Bold, weight 700) Headings: Roboto Slab Content headings (headings 1 and 2 are reserved for the vets.gov header and breadcrumb navigation) Heading 3 Heading 4 Heading 5 Heading 6 Palette Colors Primary (Hex value: #0071bc) Primary Darker (Hex value: #205493) Primary Darkest (Hex value: #112e51) Gray Dark (Hex value: #323a45) Gray Lightest (Hex value: #f1f1f1) Gold (Hex value: #FAC922) Green (Hex value: #2e8540) Green lightest (Hex value: #e7f4e4) Imagery Guidelines Generally, vets.gov avoids the use of imagery, icons and other visual embelishments. If an image is to be used, it should convey content that can not be adequately conveyed by text alone. If an image is used, be sure to caption the meaning of the content through the use of an alt tag to maintain Section 508 accessibility compliance. If icons are needed, as in a specific application context, Vets.gov uses Font Awesome as its standard.
